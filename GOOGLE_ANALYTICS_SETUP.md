# Google Analytics Setup for Neo UI

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Google Analytics has been successfully implemented across both your Neo UI sites using the measurement ID: **`G-0RNTVD4SK0`**

## 📊 Single vs Multiple Measurement IDs

### ✅ **Recommended: Single ID (Current Setup)**

**You're using the SAME measurement ID for both sites - this is PERFECT for your use case!**

**Benefits:**

- **Unified Analytics Dashboard** - See all Neo UI traffic in one place
- **Cross-site User Journey** - Track users moving from landing page to docs
- **Simplified Management** - One dashboard, one set of reports
- **Better Insights** - Combined metrics give fuller picture of user behavior
- **Cost Effective** - No need for multiple GA4 properties

**Perfect for:** Related websites, documentation + marketing sites, same brand/project

### Alternative: Separate IDs

You _could_ create separate measurement IDs, but this is typically only needed for:

- Completely different businesses/brands
- Different teams managing different sites
- Different privacy/compliance requirements
- Different stakeholder reporting needs

## 🔧 Current Implementation

- **Location**: Directly in `index.html` `<head>` section
- **Tracking**: Enhanced measurement enabled
- **Custom Events**: Site section tracking (`landing_page`)
- **Features**: Page views, enhanced ecommerce, scroll tracking

### Documentation (`/docs`)

- **Location**: Docusaurus plugin configuration
- **Tracking**: Enhanced measurement enabled
- **Custom Events**: Automatic docs-specific events
- **Features**: Search tracking, page views, engagement

## 📈 What You Can Track
